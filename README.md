Do you want to create fancy 2D dashboards for streaming or know how to create games? Then this tutorial is the best way to get started.

This tutorial is based on the arcade module.
Arcade can be used to create 2D applications and runs on many platforms, including Raspberry Pi.

## Outline

I'm doing interactive live coding, you can always interrupt and ask questions and I may adapt the code.

### Introduction

- Introduction to (object oriented) programming with Arcade
- Drawing things
- Event Handling
- Animation Basics
- Image Handling
- Text Handling

### First Application: Earthquake Map

we create a simple dashboard application showing latest earthquakes worldwide on a map using real time data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey)

### Second Application: Scrolling Shooter Game

We create a vertically scrolling shooter game where you navigate a space ship through a field of asteroids
