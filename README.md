Do you want to create fancy 2D dashboards for streaming or know how to create games? Then this tutorial is the best way to get started.

This tutorial is based on the arcade module.
Arcade can be used to create 2D applications and runs on many platforms, including Raspberry Pi.

We start using basic drawing commands and go on to drawing images, interact with mouse, keyboard or even a game controller.

Then we create two sample applications together:

- First we create a simple dashboard application showing latest earthquakes worldwide on a map using real time data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey)
- The second application we create together is a vertically scrolling shooter game where you navigate a space ship through a field of asteroids.
